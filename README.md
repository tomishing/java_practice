# java_practice

This repository serves as a storage space for Java code I practiced during college. It is primarily for my personal records to prevent forgetting what Iâ€™ve learned. It includes various programming exercises from Java Programming (10th ed.) by Joyce Farrell (2023, Cengage), as well as assignments from my college Java class.
